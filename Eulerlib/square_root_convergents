"""
It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.

By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

    3/2   = 1.5
    7/5   = 1.4
    17/12 = 1.41666…
    41/29 = 1.41379…

The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the
first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.

In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?
